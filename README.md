# Sphere¬≤ Lamp

A spherical design lamp with 122 domes, illuminated by individually controlled RGB LEDs.
Using animated color effects, the lamp creates a unique atmosphere.
It can be controlled over USB or Bluetooth.

### Code

The LED strip is driven by an Arduino Nano which generates the colorful animations.
The complete code is located in [code/sphere2-lamp](code/sphere2-lamp).
It uses the [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library and features a modular serial interface to adjust the animation parameters or manually control the LEDs of the Sphere¬≤ Lamp.

By connecting to the serial interface of the Arduino Nano, one can use:
- A python program to control the Sphere¬≤ Lamp over USB from a computer.
  The python class as well as a vpython based interactive 3D control UI can be found in [code/sphere2-lamp-python-controller](code/sphere2-lamp-python-controller).  
- An Arduino Nano 33 BLE<sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> to control the Sphere¬≤ Lamp over **Bluetooth low energy (BLE)** from a smartphone.
  The code for the BLE controller is located in [code/sphere2-lamp-ble-controller](code/sphere2-lamp-ble-controller).  
  A compatible android app for control via BLE can be found in [code/sphere2-lamp-ble-remote-android-app](code/sphere2-lamp-ble-remote-android-app) and is also available from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.eltos.sphere2lamp).


<a name="footnote-1">[1]</a>: Since the FastLED library is not compatible with the Nano BLE as of now, the Nano BLE provides only the Bluetooth interface and connects to the Nano (which controls the LEDs) via the serial interface. The benefit of this approach is a modular flexibility.


### Community

A variation of the lamp using 3D printed hexagons was created by Jos√© Manuel Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez in 2021. Make sure to check it out on his [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/2CoAVQVOjtA) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXEKfohqzcN).
